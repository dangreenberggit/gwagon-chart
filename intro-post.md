Hey nerds, I considered posting this in the /dataisugly sub but figured I'd try to get roasted here instead.

I've had G-wagons bouncing around in my head, and trickles of info (some direct from buyers) about various major tax benefits for buying SUVs. I put together a visualization to explore this (hence the line toggles I left in), and I thought it might be worth quickly sharing on the interwebs.

The chart compares these three metrics starting in 2012 and indexed to 100 to see how they've moved relative to each other. Is that the best way of doing it? I'm not sure. I haven't taken a math class since HS. What do you all think? I enjoy any feedback. The site has other charts too (for more fodder if so desired).
